# Cloud Concepts
### Agenda
1. Cloud Concepts
    - What Is a Cloud Service?
    - Types of Cloud Models
    - Types of Cloud Services
2. Deployment options

***Cloud computing*** is the delivery of compute services, such as servers, storages, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence via Internet.\
The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining and keeping up-to-date the physical hardware required to execute your work.
- Computing power, such as Linux servers or web applications
- Storage, such as files and databases
- Networking, such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company
- Analytics, such as visualizing telemetry and performance data

### Key characteristics and considerations of cloud services:
- **High availability**.The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time with very little downtime depending on the service.
- **Scalability**.The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload.
- **Elasticity**.The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match current needs. They are added or removed automatically to meet future needs taking into account the most advantageous geographic location as well. Unlike scalability, elasticity is done automatically.
- **Agility**.The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on demand via self-service, so vast number of compute resources can be provided or removed in minutes with no manual intervention.
- **Fault tolerance**.The ability to remain up and running even if a component or service no longer functions. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture so that there is always a backup component. 
- **Disaster recovery**.The ability to recover from an event that has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery is done quickly and automatically.
- **Customer latency capabilities**.If customers experience slowness with a particular cloud service, that means they experience some latency. Cloud services have the ability to deploy resources in data centers around the globe, thus addressing customer latency issues.
- **Predictive cost considerations**.The ability for users to predict how much they will pay for a particular cloud service. Costs for individual services are available, and tools are provided to allow you to predict costs. 
- **Increased productivity**.On-site data centers typically require a lot of hardware set-up (also known as racking and stacking), software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. 
- **Technical skill requirements and considerations**.Cloud services can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Therefore, getting workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical resources than having IT teams build and maintain physical infrastructure for handling the same workload.
- **Security**.Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide better security than most organizations can achieve. 
- **Global reach**.The ability to reach audiences around the globe. Cloud services can access any region making you present there even though you may not have any infrastructure in that region.
### CapEx vs OpEx
**Capital Expenditure** \
This is spending money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. 
CapEx is an upfront cost that has a value that reduces over time. \
**Operational Expenditure** \
This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill within a year. There are no upfront costs, and you pay for a service or product as you use it. \
***A typical on-premises data center includes such costs:***
- Server costs
- Storage costs
- Network costs
- Backup and archive costs
- Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs
- Data center infrastructure costs
- Technical personnel costs
### Types of Cloud Models
- Public cloud
- Private cloud 
- Hybrid cloud

### Shared Responsibility Model
- **IaaS** requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications.
- **PaaS** requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store.
- **SaaS** requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.\

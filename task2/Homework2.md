# Homework

- Get test account on Azure (if not done yet)
- Create 2 Linux VMs with webserver (Apache or nginx) installed
- Configure loadbalancer to serve data from these VMs
- Export resulting infrastructure as a ARM template and commit to your repository.
- Extra points: Web-server installation should be handled by template
